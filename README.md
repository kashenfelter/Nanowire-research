# Nanowire-research
This repo contains codes and materials from my computational research on random nanowire networks. I developed a computational model for random nanowire networks, which is written in Python. I used this model to optimize performance of the networks with respect to nanowire orientation, and discovered a new network arrangement to improve conductivity. My results are published with myself as first author (document included), and won 2nd Place nationwide at the Intel Science Talent Search (materials included) and 3rd Place nationwide at the Siemens Competition.  

This project was conducted before I had taken any formal CS classes, and my python scripts are thus badly formatted. I've retroactively commented them so that I can understand and explain every line, and will probably spend an extended amount of time rewriting everything in the future. To execute the codes, first run the network generator, then run the conductivity calculator. Do not change any of the files produced by the network generator.
