# Nanowire-research
This repo contains codes and materials from my computational research on random nanowire networks. This project was conducted before I had taken any formal CS classes, and my python scripts are thus badly formatted and difficult to read. I've retroactively commented them so that I can understand and explain every line, and will probably spend an extended amount of time rewriting everything in the future. To execute the codes, first run the network generator, then run the conductivity calculator. Do not change any of the files produced by the network generator. 

Other materials I've included include my published paper as well as my paper and poster from the Intel Science Talent Search competition, where I won 2nd Place nationwide.
